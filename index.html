   <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="My Profile Picture" width="200">
  <p>I am a Part III Mathematics student at the University of Cambridge and will be continuing at Cambridge to start a PhD in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics in October 2025, under the supervision of Professor Anders C. Hansen. 
    My research interests are mainly in various applications of Functional Analysis, including Spectral Theory and Approximation Theory.
    I previously completed a BSc in Mathematics at the University of Warwick, where I focused mainly on Analysis.
    For my Part III Essay, I have been working on extending new methods in Dynamic Mode Decomposition to continuous time systems, including residual DMD, spectral measure computations and measure preserving EDMD. These are all techniques to approximate 
    the Koopman generator of a dynamical system whilst preserving as much accuracy as possible.
